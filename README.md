# slime
A simple slime mold simulation based on this paper https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579. As always it is painfully slow and unoptimized, any pull request
implementing asynchronous agents updates would be highly appreciated.
## how to run
Once in the project folder, type in a command line "make all" and then "./bin/Slime". Note that this was made for a linux system, to run it on Windows you would
have to change the SFML files and edit the makefile.
